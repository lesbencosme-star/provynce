All stations feature full ADA accessibility (elevators, tactile guidance, audio announcements), rooftop solar panels generating 2 MW of clean energy, real-time arrival displays, and contactless payment systems. The project creates 1,847 construction jobs and will reduce annual CO2 emissions by 12,500 tons while improving air quality in surrounding communities.",
